üìå Linux for DevOps & Cloud ‚Äì Complete Syllabus
Month 1 ‚Äì Linux Foundations (Beginner ‚Üí Intermediate)
Week 1 ‚Äì Getting Started with Linux
What is Linux? Why DevOps Engineers must know it.


Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, RHEL).


Installing Linux (VM, WSL, Cloud VM).


Linux file system hierarchy.


Basic navigation: pwd, ls, cd, tree.


File operations: cat, touch, cp, mv, rm.


Help commands: man, --help, info.


‚úçÔ∏è Whiteboard ‚Üí Linux directory structure tree.

Week 2 ‚Äì Users, Permissions & Processes
Creating users & groups (useradd, groupadd, passwd).


File permissions & ownership (chmod, chown, umask).


SUID, SGID, sticky bit.


Process management: ps, top, htop, kill, nice, renice.


System services with systemctl.


Mini Demo: Add a user, assign permissions, manage a service.

Week 3 ‚Äì Files, Editors & Package Management
File viewing: less, head, tail, wc, grep.


File compression: tar, gzip, bzip2, zip.


Editors: nano, vim basics (must know for DevOps).


Package managers: apt, yum, dnf.


Installing software from repos.


Mini Demo: Install and configure nginx or apache2.

Week 4 ‚Äì Networking Basics for DevOps
IP, DNS, hostname, /etc/hosts.


Network tools: ping, traceroute, nslookup, dig.


Checking ports: netstat, ss, lsof.


üî• Networking tools in DevOps pipelines ‚Üí curl, wget, scp, rsync.


SSH basics: connecting to remote servers.


Mini Demo: Download a file via curl, copy files via scp.

Month 2 ‚Äì Advanced Linux for DevOps
Week 5 ‚Äì Storage, Disk & System Monitoring
Disk partitions & mount points.


File systems: ext4, xfs.


Disk usage monitoring: df, du.


I/O monitoring: iotop, dstat.


Memory & CPU monitoring: free, uptime, vmstat.


Mini Demo: Monitor a VM‚Äôs health while running stress test.

Week 6 ‚Äì Advanced Scripting & Automation
Bash scripting basics (variables, conditionals, loops).


Writing scripts with #!/bin/bash.


Automating repetitive tasks.


Scheduling jobs with cron.


Logging & debugging scripts.


Mini Demo: Write a script to rotate logs.

Week 7 ‚Äì Practical DevOps Linux
üî• Optional Mini Project ‚Äì Automation


Script that checks server health (disk, CPU, RAM, processes).


Stores results in a log file.


Emails/Sends alert if threshold is crossed.


Environment variables (export, .bashrc).


Aliases & custom shell shortcuts.



Week 8 ‚Äì DevOps & Cloud Integration
Linux in Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).


Running background processes (nohup, &, screen, tmux).


System logs: /var/log.


Log monitoring with tail -f.


Introduction to Linux security (firewalld, ufw, SELinux basics).


Real-world DevOps tasks (debugging a failed CI/CD build due to missing tool).



‚úÖ Final Output for Students
By the end of this course, learners will:
Comfortably use Linux as a daily DevOps engineer‚Äôs tool.


Debug CI/CD pipelines when tools like curl, wget, or scp fail.


Automate monitoring tasks with shell scripts.


Be ready for Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Cloud.
